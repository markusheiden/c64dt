*** Document revision 1.0

  All of the information contained in this document has  been  gathered  by
dissecting various FD2000 floppy images (in D2M  format),  comparing  them,
and arriving at some well-educated conclusions. Comparisons to  some  other
disk types (D81, D64) have helped  immeasurably.  Therefore,  some  of  the
information presented here might not be accurate or complete.

  The FD2000 drive is an incredibly  compatible  device.  It  is  backwards
compatible  to  the  Commodore  1581  floppies,   contains   the   JiffyDos
fastloader, and even supports the GEOS  OS.  Inserting  a  native-formatted
FD2000 floppy keeps the drive in its native mode support, but  inserting  a
1581-formatted disk will put the drive into "1581 compatible" mode. It even
supports  "emulated"  partitions  of  1541,  1571   and   1581   disks   on
native-formatted disks.

  There are several different ways to view the layout of  FD2000  floppies.
At the controller level, the  disk  has  81  tracks  (0  to  80  physically
numbered), 10 sectors-per-track, 2 disk sides with 1024 bytes  per  sector.
In Commodore logical terms,  it  has  81  tracks  (1  to  81  logical),  80
sectors-per-track with 256 bytes per sector, totalling 6480 sectors  total.
This makes the disk 1.56Mb in  size.  The  last  track  (81,  image  offset
$190000) is reserved and should not be used for data  storage.  This  makes
the file size 1658880 without error bytes attached, or 1665360  bytes  with
error bytes attached.

  Seeing as the disk is 6480  sectors  large,  we  need  6480  error  bytes
attached to the end of the image for an extended image type. About the only
use for the error bytes is when emulating 1541 or 1571 drive types,  and  a
bad sector for copy protection is needed. The job codes these  error  bytes
represent only really apply the 1541 and 1571 drives.

  However, it is difficult to speak about the number of sectors  per  track
as the FD2000 doesn't follow the routine of "x"  sectors-per-track  in  the
normal sense of Commodore disks. Each  "track"  is  a  64Kb  chunk  of  256
sectors each. This means that the FD2000 only uses  25  of  these  "tracks"
over the whole disk. For the most part, it is these  type  of  tracks  that
will be mentioned from here on. The only exception is  for  track  81,  the
system partition track.

  So, what does it mean when track 2 sector 233 ($02/$E9) is  accessed?  To
answer this,  we  need  to  convert  the  track  and  sector  numbers  into
HEXADECIMAL, because calculating the resulting offset location become  very
simple. Taking the example above (track 2 sector 233), convert them to  HEX
numbers...

     track 2   -> $02
    sector 233 -> $E9

  subtract 1 from the track value (because all track references are from 1,
not zero), attach the sector value to the end, and then attach a $00 to the
end...

    ($track-1):$sector:$00  or  $01E900.

  This is the offset value into the existing partition to  access  track  1
sector 233.

  Additionally, each partition internally always starts from track  1.  How
is this possible? Well, the system partition table specifies what offset  a
partition starts at (in system blocks), and once inside the partition,  all
track references now start at 1. This means *you* must keep  track  of  the
offset where each partition exists once you are inside. As  a  bonus,  this
also means that moving a partition from one disk to another should be  very
simple because the track/sector pointers contained at the beginning of each
sector are "relative" and do not have to be adjusted.

  The FD2000 is capable of storing  up  to  31  separate  partitions  (also
called segments), each assigned its  own  unique  ID  number.  One  of  the
partitions will be set as the default so that when the disk is inserted  in
the floppy, the default partition will be entered automatically. The  first
entry is always set as the "system" entry.

  There are several different types of partitions, which are...

   Type  Description                 Size
   ----  --------------------------- -----------------------------------
    00   No partition                0
    01   Native partition            variable (min 256 512-byte blocks)
    02   Emulated 1541 drive (D64)   342 512-byte blocks (684 sectors)
    03   Emulated 1571 drive (D71)   684 512-byte blocks (1368 sectors)
    04   Emulated 1581 drive (D81)   1600 512-byte blocks (3200 sectors)
   255   System partition (track 81)

  The emulated drive partitions are a direct sector copy of the disk  type.
This means the track/sector references are just as a normal disk would  be,
even though the FD2000 doesn't normally do things this way. If you were  to
sector-by-sector copy the data out from this emulated partition  to  a  new
file, you would have a D64 (or D71/D81) image file in all respects.

  There are two things to watch out for if you intend to copy the data from
emulated partitions out to a real disk. Both the 1541 and the 1571  contain
extra "filler" sectors on the end. The 1541  contains  one,  and  the  1571
contains two. A partial explanation for this behaviour is that  the  FD2000
system partition works with 512-byte blocks, meaning all partitions must be
even numbers (in 256-byte blocks). Therefore the 1541 size  is  incremented
to the next logical size (684) to make is an even value. The 1571 is simply
a doubling of the 1541 size, even though this means it now  contains  *two*
extra filler sectors (which are now completely unnecessary).

  For more information on the layout of 1541 (D64), 1571 (D71), 1581 (D81),
GEOS, REL or any  of  the  specific  file  types  on  the  disks,  see  the
appropriate documentation which should be included with this one.

  It's the "native" partition type which is the most difficult to work with
because it is capable of so much, but in many ways it doesn't work the same
way any of the existing Commodore drives do.




The System Partition
--------------------

  The system partition exists at logical track 81 (offset $190000), and  is
broken up into several different areas. With 80 sectors on the track, there
is potentially a lot of information. However, only  sector  #5  and  #8-#11
seem to be used.

  Sector #5 (offset $190500) holds the DevBlock,  the  "device  information
block". Most of the information here is unknown,  but  it  likely  contains
information about the device itself, and possibly which partition is set as
the default. This block should be duplicated as-is when  generating  a  D2M
image file as it does not appear to change across any of  the  images  that
have been seen.

  Notice that the sector links are $01/$01, $01/$02, $01/$03, and ends with
a $00/$FF. This is an example of partitions starting at track 1 internally.
Therefore, even though the system  partition  starts  at  #81/#5,  this  is
actually logical track/sector $01/$00.

  The first entry is the root name. This entry must exist first...

           1E-1F: Partition size, in hi/lo format (note that  these  blocks
                  are again 512-bytes in size)

  *Note: the "partition size" and "starting offset" values are  some  other
examples of the oddities of the FD2000 layout. They are counted in 512-byte
sectors, not the standard 256-byte sectors of other Commodore  disks.  What
this means is you must double the value to get the actual size in  256-byte
sectors.

  In the case of emulated drive partitions, the size is already  known,  as
it is a sector-for-sector duplicate of the emulated disk. An emulated  1541
disk will have one extra sector at the end of the image because  it  is  an
odd size (683) and the size must always be even,  being  multiples  of  512
bytes.

  The third partition example from above ("1571PARTITION")  shows  a  block
offset of $0640 and a block size of $02AC.  Since  these  are  in  512-byte
blocks, we need to double them to  get  the  real  256-byte  sector  values
($0C80 and $0558). This means that this partition  starts  at  file  offset
$0C8000, and is $0558 (or #1368) sectors large. The file offset number must
be remembered as all references within the partition must be added  to  the
above offset value to get the real offset into the D2M image.



Native Partitions
-----------------

  All partitions must start on a 512 byte boundary, and end on one as well.
The minimum size for a native  partition  is  256  system  blocks  (or  512
sectors in 256-byte sectors). Part of the reason for the  minimum  size  is
the number of blocks that the BAM and other areas allocate (35 blocks) even
before you get a chance to do anything.

  Now, for some unknown reason, the first  sector  of  a  native  partition
($01/$00) is empty, so the partition  HEX  dump  will  start  at  the  next
sector, $01/$01.

  The references at $20 through $26 take a  little  more  explanation.  The
track/sector link at $20-$21 points to the header of the present directory.
This way when you are in the directory listing, you know where  the  header
block is, and it can be accessed to find out how to go back one  level,  or
change the header name, etc.

  The t/s link at $22-23 points back to the immediately previous  directory
(parent entry), allowing you to go backwards up the directory tree one step
at a time. Note that there is no value for a jump back  to  the  top  level
directory. This value is known only when you enter the partition.

  The t/s link at $24-25 points to the  sector  where  the  entry  for  the
present directory name exists (one level up), and the value at $26  is  the
real index into this sector pointing directly at the name.  This  entry  is
important because if you add extra entries  to  a  directory,  forcing  the
addition of another sector, the parent entry must be  updated  with  a  new
block count. The reference at $24-26 tells you  exactly  where  the  parent
entry is.


  The BAM map for *this* partition starts at track #1 sector #2 and extends
up to sector #33. Why is it 32 sectors long? Well, each  partition  appears
to have the theoretical capability of accessing up to  255  tracks  at  256
sectors each. This makes the BAM table 8160 bytes long, or approximately 32
sectors. Since any partition is much smaller than this (only up to track 25
of 255), most of the table is unused and filled with $FF's. Therefore,  all
BAM tables will only go up to sector #5, the rest is unused.

  Byte #0 covers sector 0-7, #1 covers 8-15 and so on. A '1' bit means  the
sector is free, and a '0' bit means the sector is allocated (used). For  an
empty partition, sectors 0-34 are always allocated. Note that  even  though
sector 0 is not used (completely empty), it is still allocated.


  Looking back to the first sector of the partition block, it had the  next
t/s link set as $01/$22 (offset $002200), so  here  is  the  dump  of  that
sector, which is the first directory block. This block is very  similar  in
layout to a normal disk (D64, etc) containing GEOS files.

                   descriptor)
            19-1D: File time/date stamp (seconds are not stored).  This  is
                   the same timestamp that GEOS uses.

            1E-1F: Entry size in sectors, low/high byte order ($1E + $1F  *
                   256). The filesize in bytes is <= #sectors * 254
            20-3F: Second dir entry. From now on the  first  two  bytes  of
                   each entry in the sector should be $00/$00, as they  are
                   unused.
            40-5F: Third dir entry
            60-7F: Fourth dir entry
            80-9F: Fifth dir entry
            A0-BF: Sixth dir entry
            C0-DF: Seventh dir entry
            E0-FF: Eighth dir entry

  The above "entry size" can either be the sector count of the  file  entry
(file size), or the subdirectory size if it's a subdirectory. If it is  the
subdirectory  size,  it  counts  both  the  header  and  directory  blocks.

  Directory space is allocated dynamically, so the size will vary depending
on how many entries are in the subdirectory, and how many blocks the  whole
directory takes. It might help to think of the FD2000  directory  structure
and capabilities as you would on a MSDOS machine. They  are  both  dynamic,
and can have as many subdirectories as disk space allows. The  "xxx  blocks
free" that would be seen after a directory listing would apply  across  the
entire partition, as does the BAM for the partition.

  Also note the timestamp on bytes $19-1D. The FD2000 drive has a  built-in
real-time clock, allowing for an  accurate  time/date  stamp  on  file  and
directory creation. It is the same stamp that GEOS has used for years.  For
more info on GEOS files, read the appropriate documentation.


  Looking back at the first directory block, it had the entry  "ECHO  HAWK"
set as a subdirectory, with it's T/S location as $01/$40 (offset  $004000),
and it's block size as 2. Here is the dump  of  the  first  block  of  that
subdirectory.

  Each directory is preceeded by this "header" block,  including  the  root
(from above). This block is necessary because it is the only location which
can hold the "directory" name,  and  all  the  track/sector  pointers  into
various levels of the directory structure.


  From here, we go to the next block of the directory, holding  the  actual
file listing, possibly with more subdirectories. This is block #2  (out  of
2) of the entry total. The layout  and  description  is  the  same  as  the
previous example of the first directory block.




Creating A D2M Image
--------------------

  Follow these steps to create a  D2M  image.  These  instructions  do  now
describe how to create a partition entry or subdirectories. For this  info,
you will need to read the above information very carefully.

  1. Create a new file, and write out 6480 256-byte blocks of zero's.

  2. If you need error bytes, write out another 6480 bytes of  $01's.  This
     is the job code for "no error".

  3. Copy the DevBlock exactly, as shown previously (located in an existing
     image at track 81, sector 5, or offset $190500).

  4. Create the system partition  as  described  above  (track  81,  sector
     8-11).

  5. Make sure the "SYSTEM" entry exists as the first entry in  the  system
     partition.
